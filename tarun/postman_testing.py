3 Ideas From Me
---------------

I.

"Clarity isn't about knowing what you want to do with your life,
it's about knowing what you want to do this week.

You don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to know
your next step."

))

​II.

"Your life will not magically exceed your standards. Improve your
boundaries and life improves too."

))

III.

"You can cold email nearly anyone, but nearly everyone overlooks
how powerful it can be.

Sending one email each week that feels like a stretch can change
your life. Will you get turned down? Sure, most of the time. But
you only need one to pay off for something amazing to happen.

Take your time, write a thoughtful message, and muster the
courage to press Send."

2 Quotes From Others
--------------------

I.

Software engineer David Clarke on priorities:

"20 years from now, the only people who will remember that you
worked late are your kids."

​II.

Sociology professor Daniel Chambliss, who spent years researching
the qualities of elite swimmers, on what creates excellence:
​"Excellence is mundane. Superlative performance is really a
confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one
learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into
habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There
is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those
actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and
correctly, and all together, produce excellence.

When a swimmer learns a proper flip turn in the freestyle races,
she will swim the race a bit faster; then a streamlined push off
from the wall, with the arms squeezed together over the head, and
a little faster; then how to place the hands in the water so no
air is cupped in them; then how to lift them over the water; then
how to lift weights to properly build strength, and how to eat
the right foods, and to wear the best suits for racing, and on
and on.

Each of those tasks seems small in itself, but each allows the
athlete to swim a bit faster. And having learned and consistently
practiced all of them together, and many more besides, the
swimmer may compete in the Olympic Games... the little things
really do count."

1 Question For You
------------------

What is something you would be proud to fail on, if you had the
courage to attempt it?
